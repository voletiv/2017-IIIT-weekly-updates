<h3 id="observations">OBSERVATIONS</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>In both speaker-dependent and speaker-independent cases, validation accuracy does not change much with/without face alignment.</p></li>

<li><p>Training on unaligned images gives best accuracies in all cases.</p></li>

<li><p>Mean subtraction gives better results for speaker-dependent tasks, but worse results for speaker-independent tasks</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion-1">CONCLUSION</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>It is advisable to not align face, i.e. to not use pose information while training for lipreading</p></li>

<li><p>It is also advisable to not subtract mean image of training images, since using the same mean image on speaker-independent tasks leads to worse accuracies, although for speaker-dependent tasks, it leads to better accuracies.</p></li>
</ul>
